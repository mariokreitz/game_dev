# Canvas Projects 🎨🎶

Welcome to my **Canvas Projects** repository—a creative hub where I experiment, learn, and document my journey with the **Canvas** element and **Web Audio API**. Each project here is a stepping stone towards mastering web-based visuals, immersive audio, and clean, organized code.

## 🌟 Project Collection

- **[Audio Visual Effects](audio_visual_effects)** 🎧  
  Explore how sound and visuals come together! Here, I sync audio with dynamic visuals using Canvas and the Web Audio API, building interactive experiences that respond to sound in real-time.

- **[Collision Detection](collision_detection)** 🎯  
  Practicing the fundamentals of collision detection with moving circles—a critical skill for interactive graphics and game development.

- **[Flying Creatures](flying_creatures)** 🦋  
  A playful project where I animate "creatures" to flutter across the screen, enhancing my skills in movement, animation, and pathfinding on the canvas.

- **[Parallax Effect](parallax)** 🌌  
  Experimenting with parallax scrolling to create depth and perspective, adding layers that bring scenes to life with dynamic motion.

- **[Sprite Animation](sprite_animation)** 🎞️  
  Delving into frame-by-frame sprite animation to animate characters and objects—a foundational technique for lively, interactive experiences.

## 🎮 Featured Projects

### [Simple Side Scroller](simple_side_scroller) 🕹️

**Simple Side Scroller** is a 2D game where players earn points by jumping over enemies, showcasing my growth in web game development. It’s based on my **game_dev** repository and features:

- **Fullscreen Mode**: Switch to fullscreen for immersive gameplay.
- **Debug Mode**: Toggle hitboxes around the player and enemies, a "debug" indicator, and an FPS counter.
- **Restart Functionality**: Tap on mobile or press Enter on desktop to restart the game.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Play on mobile with jump controls (no left/right movement), allowing easy on-the-go gameplay.

This project captures key gameplay elements—scoring, character movement, and debugging—that build on skills from the **game_dev** repository.

### [Raven Hunter](https://github.com/AndreiDoroshin/raven-hunter)

**Raven Hunter** is another key project that integrates Canvas animations, collision detection, and dynamic effects, bringing together various techniques from the Canvas Projects repository into a cohesive game experience. It serves as a showcase of my progress and my ability to create engaging, interactive environments.

## 📂 Code Structure and Class Organization

This repository also explores modular code organization in the **code_structure** folder, where I apply object-oriented principles, encapsulation, and naming conventions:

- Inside the **classes** directory, files like `enemies.class.js` demonstrate my learning in class structures and modular design, keeping code organized and scalable.

Each folder serves as a learning module with code snippets, notes, and setup instructions, capturing each new concept and skill as I grow in game development and web graphics!
