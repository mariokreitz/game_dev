# Canvas Projects 🎨🎶

Welcome to my **Canvas Projects** repository—a space where I explore, experiment, and track my progress with the **Canvas** element and **Web Audio API**. Each project here is a hands-on step in my journey to understand web-based visuals, audio effects, and effective code organization.

## Project Collection

- **[Audio Visual Effects](audio_visual_effects)** 🎧  
  Learning to sync audio with dynamic visuals using Canvas and the Web Audio API for immersive experiences.

- **[Collision Detection](collision_detection)** 🎯
  Practicing collision detection between circles, a fundamental concept for interactive canvas projects.

- **[Flying Creatures](flying_creatures)** 🦋  
  Bringing movement to the canvas with "creatures" that roam freely, honing animation and pathfinding techniques.

- **[Parallax Effect](parallax)** 🌌  
  Adding depth and perspective through parallax, creating visually layered effects.

- **[Sprite Animation](sprite_animation)** 🎞️
  Exploring frame-by-frame animation to make characters and objects come alive on the canvas.

### Code Structure and Class Organization 📂

This repository also includes a **code_structure** folder, where I dive into class structures and code organization. Inside the **classes** directory, files like `enemies.class.js` apply the naming conventions and modular coding techniques I've learned. This structure keeps code clean and manageable, making it easier to expand on features and apply object-oriented principles in JavaScript.

Each folder documents my progress with code snippets, notes, and setup instructions. It’s my learning playground, capturing every new skill and concept as I grow in game development and web graphics!
