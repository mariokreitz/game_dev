# Canvas Projects 🎨🎶

Welcome to my **Canvas Projects** repository—a place where I explore, experiment, and track my progress with the **Canvas** element and **Web Audio API**. Each project here is a hands-on step in my journey to understand web-based visuals and audio effects.

## Project Collection

- **[Audio Visual Effects](audio_visual_effects)** 🎧  
  Dive into audio visualizations! Here, I’m learning how to sync audio with dynamic visuals using Canvas and the Web Audio API.

- **[Collision Detection](collision_detection)** 🎯  
  Practicing collision detection between circles—a fundamental for any interactive canvas project.

- **[Flying Creatures](flying_creatures)** 🦋  
  Bringing motion to the canvas by animating "creatures" that move around the screen.

- **[Parallax Effect](parallax)** 🌌  
  Adding depth through parallax, creating a sense of layers and perspective.

- **[Sprite Animation](sprite_animation)** 🎞️  
  Exploring frame-by-frame animation techniques for sprites to make them come to life.
