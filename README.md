# Canvas Projects 🎨🎶

Welcome to my **Canvas Projects** repository—a creative hub where I experiment, learn, and document my journey with the **Canvas** element and **Web Audio API**. Each project here is a stepping stone towards mastering web-based visuals, immersive audio, and clean, organized code.

## 🌟 Project Collection

- **[Audio Visual Effects](audio_visual_effects)** 🎧  
  Explore how sound and visuals come together! Here, I sync audio with dynamic visuals using Canvas and the Web Audio API, building interactive experiences that respond to sound in real-time.

- **[Collision Detection](collision_detection)** 🎯  
  Practicing the fundamentals of collision detection with moving circles—a critical skill for interactive graphics and game development.

- **[Flying Creatures](flying_creatures)** 🦋  
  A playful project where I animate "creatures" to flutter across the screen, enhancing my skills in movement, animation, and pathfinding on the canvas.

- **[Parallax Effect](parallax)** 🌌  
  Experimenting with parallax scrolling to create depth and perspective, adding layers that bring scenes to life with dynamic motion.

- **[Sprite Animation](sprite_animation)** 🎞️  
  Delving into frame-by-frame sprite animation to animate characters and objects—a foundational technique for lively, interactive experiences.

## 📂 Code Structure and Class Organization

In this repository, I also explore modular code organization in the **code_structure** folder. Here, I focus on class structures, encapsulation, and naming conventions:

- Inside the **classes** directory, files like `enemies.class.js` highlight my progress in object-oriented principles and modular code design. This organization ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable code that’s easy to expand as projects grow.

Each folder serves as a learning module with code snippets, notes, and setup instructions. This space is my creative lab, capturing every new concept and skill as I grow in game development and web graphics!

## 🔥 Project Highlight: Raven Hunter

The **[Raven Hunter](https://github.com/mariokreitz/raven-hunter)** project brings these elements together, integrating Canvas animation, collision detection, and dynamic effects. It serves as both a showcase of my progress and a test of my ability to combine multiple techniques into a cohesive game environment.
